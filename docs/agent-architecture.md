# Cosmic Agent Architecture

This document captures the planned direction for persistent server-side agents.
Agents are real characters temporarily driven by server runtime code. They should
remain playable by a human account when not controlled by the agent runtime.

## Goals

- Keep `main` stable before agent work expands.
- Build agents behind a runtime/module boundary instead of scattering control
  logic directly through core gameplay classes.
- Start with scripted, deterministic behavior.
- Allow an optional local LLM plugin for dialogue/personality, not unrestricted
  gameplay control.
- Preserve the server as the source of truth for movement, combat, inventory,
  trading, shops, chat, and economy.
- Make every economic action observable even when agents are allowed to trade
  and affect the economy freely.

## Control Planes

### Agent CMS

For server-owned agents and admin operations:

- create/manage agent accounts and characters
- assign behavior profiles, scripts, personalities, and goals
- deploy/despawn agents by world/channel/map
- monitor current state, action, map, HP/MP, inventory pressure, and errors
- inspect chat, trade, loot, stall, and meso ledgers

### Player CMS

For player-owned characters:

- enable or disable offline autopilot
- choose behavior limits and target goals
- inspect live status while the character is agent-controlled
- chat through the character while it is controlled by the agent runtime
- take over safely by logging in with the normal client

### Server CMS

Server CMS remains the technical operations console:

- server configuration
- runtime limits
- diagnostics
- module enablement
- agent runtime safety limits when those settings are technical rather than
  gameplay/economy balance

## Runtime Layers

```text
Cosmic Server
  -> RuntimeModuleManager
      -> AgentRuntimeModule
          -> AgentRegistry
          -> AgentController
          -> AgentScheduler
          -> AgentPolicy
          -> AgentScriptRunner
          -> AgentGoalPlanner
          -> AgentCommunicationBus
          -> AgentEconomyLedger
          -> Optional LLM Adapter
```

The runtime module layer is intentionally small. Optional systems should start,
stop, and fail independently so the core server remains stable.

## Agent Types

- **Server Agent**: server-owned persistent character managed through Agent CMS.
- **Player Agent**: player-owned character running offline autopilot.
- **Companion Agent**: assigned to follow/help a player.
- **Simulation Agent**: controlled actor for load tests or event simulation.

Every persistent agent should map to a normal `characters.id` so it can be saved,
loaded, traded with, equipped, and manually played when not agent-controlled.

## Behavior Model

Default behavior should be script-first:

```text
perception -> script/goal planner -> policy check -> controller action
```

LLM can be plugged in later for:

- dialogue
- personality
- explanations
- lightweight social decisions

LLM output should become an intent that still passes through policy and
controller validation.

## First Milestones

1. **Runtime foundation**
   - module lifecycle
   - lifecycle events
   - safe startup/shutdown hooks

2. **Agent data model**
   - profiles
   - ownership
   - runtime sessions
   - action logs

3. **Dormant runtime service layer**
   - profile repository
   - enabled-profile registry
   - runtime module boundary
   - no gameplay control yet

4. **Minimal runtime**
   - load a normal character through an internal client
   - spawn/despawn safely
   - prevent duplicate real-client login
   - save state on shutdown/despawn

5. **Agent CMS MVP**
   - roster
   - profile detail
   - deploy/despawn controls
   - live runtime state

6. **Same-map movement**
   - idle
   - town hangout
   - follow
   - patrol

7. **Perception**
   - nearby players
   - nearby agents
   - mobs
   - drops
   - portals
   - NPCs

8. **Communication**
   - internal agent message bus
   - say/party/whisper channels
   - CMS chat bridge

9. **Basic grinding**
   - target nearby mobs
   - move into range
   - basic attack
   - potion use
   - loot

10. **Economy**
    - trading
    - stalls
    - shop interactions
    - economy ledger

11. **Goals**
    - primary goals
    - side goals
    - progress tracking
    - blocked goal diagnostics

12. **Optional LLM**
    - local Ollama-style adapter
    - personality profiles
    - dialogue only at first

13. **World travel**
    - map portal graph
    - scroll/taxi/NPC travel policies
    - safe stuck recovery

14. **Parties and expeditions**
    - role assignment
    - readiness checks
    - coordinator-controlled boss behavior

## Design Rules

- Agent runtime must be disabled by default until explicitly enabled.
- No agent should be controlled by both a real client and runtime code.
- Runtime failures should stop the affected agent, not the whole server.
- Economy-changing actions must be logged.
- High-frequency movement/combat decisions must avoid blocking DB or LLM calls.
- LLM calls must be optional, timeout-bounded, and never required for core ticks.
- Scripts and goals should be inspectable from CMS.
